# COSC247_MDHypercube_Ratios
This is an example of Python code written for COSC-247 Machine Learning. The program calculates distance ratios between points inside a hypercube in n-dimensional euclidean space (Q1a-b). It also has methods to compute the ratios of "edge" points (Q2a), and points contained within a hypersphere inside the hypercube (Q2b).
